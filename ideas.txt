This has three parts:
Data --> Controller/Model --> Decision (buy or sell, what security)

Data: historical or current
Model/controller: White paper or trained algorithm (expected value from some metric on historical)
Decision: trading API

Implicitly:
	Feedback: some way to assess decisions (before we make them, to train, after we make them)
	Screener: way to find securities to pass to the controller to decide

Training:
	Historical Data --> Screener --> Preliminary decision framework --> Decision --> Result/Feedback

Implementation:
	Live Data --> Finalized Screener --> Finalized framework --> Decision --> Portfolio Tracker
